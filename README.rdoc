This is a simple rails app I created to teach myself JQuery, specifally JQuery UI.

There are 8 different effects on the home page. Just click on the boxes to trigger them. Refresh the page to get them back.

Also, there is a real world example as to why you might use and combine these effects to create a pleasant user experience during account creation and login.
